## Machine Leaning
01- Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studing data and statistics.
=> 데이터와 통계

02- Machine Learning is a step into the direcion of 
=> artificial intelligence (AI)

03- Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.
=> 데이터분석 하고 결과 예측

## Where To Start?

01. In this yutorial we will go back to mathmatics and syudy statistics, and how to calculate important numbers based on data sets.
02. We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers e need.
03. And we will learn how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome based on what we have learned.
